My implementation of Project 3 from the [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Program](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd801), which I am able to participate in thanks to a scholarship by Udacity and Google ðŸ¤—.

**This is still work in progress!**

## Features

* Use a (scrollable) `ListView` in the widget
* Test more sensibly
* Mock API in tests
